This Python program provides a graphical interface to input test scores, calculate average and median grades, and determine the score needed on remaining tests to achieve a desired final grade.

Features:
1.Letter Grade Conversion: Converts numeric test scores to letter grades (A, B, C, D, F).
2.Average & Median Calculation: Computes the average and median of entered test scores.
3.Score Prediction: Calculates the score needed on remaining tests to reach a desired final grade.

How It Works:
1.Input your test scores through the GUI or console.
2.Get real-time average and median calculations.
3.Enter the number of remaining tests and desired final grade.
4.The program computes the score required on remaining tests to meet the desired grade.
